can use both flight number or route to search-- use generics to make this happen in same place

try making a company of flights to all flights as covariance -- like when only one company operates flights to that area

interface, types of classes and inheritace -- during regualr code which probably have very small functionality

three tier data architecture-- when using database

enumeration-- 

annonymus functions and lambdas -- anywhere in the code

error handling try catch -- when using database

overloading overriding methods and constructors during implementing the inheretance would be best

boxing and unboxing if possible

make two homepages for customer and for admin 
loginpage only for admin and custoer directly go to the home page. There will be a link to login for the admin
